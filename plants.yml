    description: >
      Currants are bushes that grow strigs of small blueberry-sized berries that
      are sweet tart when ripe. There are two main kinds of currants: red and
      black. Red currants come in several colors such as red, pink, or white and
      have a milder flavor. Black currants range from dark purple to jet black
      and have a unique musky scent in both their leaves and berries. All
      currants require about 1000 - 1200 chill hours to break dormancy and
      produce fruit.


      ![Different kinds of currants](./currant-different-kinds-in-hand.jpg)


      Currants are very popular in Europe, but hardly available commercially in
      the U.S. due mostly to a federal ban on growing them enacted in 1920. In
      1966 the federal ban was lifted, however it is still banned to grow
      currants in some states because they are an alternate host for white pine
      blister rust.


      Currants can be eaten fresh when fully ripe and make excellent jams,
      jellies, and juice.


      > Ribes is a little bushe ... and in the tops ... are red berries in
      clusters in taste at the first somethinge sower but pleasant enough when
      they are fully ripe.

            Commercially introduced in 1933 by the University of Minnesota. Bred
            by William Horace Alderman at the Agricultural Experiment Station in
            Excelsior, Minnesota. Originally called Minnesota No. 24, this
            cultivar began to attract attention around 1920 when it was growing
            in a test plot with other seedlings of unknown parentage.

      Gooseberries are bushes that grow blueberry to grape-sized berries with
      their own unique flavor that are sweet tart when ripe. The berries have
      visible veins and range in color from green, blushed pink, red, purple,
      and even black or white. The bushes have thorns but some varieties have
      few or small thorns, while for others the berries are far enough from the
      branches to make picking easier. The bushes live and produce berries for
      25 years and sometimes more! All gooseberries require about 1000 - 1200
      chill hours to break dormancy and produce fruit.

            to the USDA ARS NCGR in 1981 and is of an unknown mixed
            European/American gooseberry pedigree. It was named after Ms. Cheryl
            Jeanne Gunning, who worked in the tissue culture laboratory from
            1981 to 1985. This variety is highly resistant to white pine blister
            rust and powdery mildew while having small thorns and dessert
            quality fruit.

      Honeyberry bushes are an edible blue honeysuckle with a circumpolar range in the northern hemisphere and are well-known in Eastern Europe, Russia, and Japan while gaining popularity in the United States & Canada as well.

      Among the first plants to bloom and produce fruit very early in the season, Honeyberries are also extremely cold-hardy, can tolerate some shade, do not require acidic soil, and live for 50+ years. Most varieties require a different variety in the same area for pollination.

      The berries are 1-3cm long with a color like a blueberry brushed grey. They taste sweet when fully ripe, but most turn blue well before being ripe. When picked too early they are sour. Ripe berries are delicious eaten fresh and can be substituted for blueberries in recipes.

            was selected in Corvallis, Oreg. as a single unique plant in 2004
            from the population of resulting seedlings. Commercially available

      Jostaberries (pronounced "yostaberries") are bushes that grow clusters of
      small to medium berries that are sweet tart when ripe. First released in
      1977, they are a tetraploid complex cross of the black currant R. nigrum,
      the North American coastal black gooseberry R. divaricatum, and the
      European gooseberry R. uva-crispa. Developed in Germany, the name is from
      the German words "<em>Jo</em>hannisbeere" (currant) and
      "<em>Sta</em>chelbeere" (gooseberry). Today several different varieties
      are available.


      Jostaberries can be eaten fresh when fully ripe and make excellent jams,
      jellies, and juice.

            Clusters of firm very dark pruple to black fruit form with 3-5
            berries. Size is between a black currant and a gooseberry, as is the
            flavor. Ripens unevenly, so pick multiple times.
          history: >
            The original jostaberry, developed in the 1955 in Breitbrunn West
            Germany by Dr. Rudolph Bauer and released in 1977. Open pollinated
            F2 cross of ('Silvergieters Schwarze' R. nigrum &#10005; 'Grüne
            Hansa' R. uva-crispa) &#10005; ('Langtraubige Schwarze' R. nigrum
            &#10005; R. divaricatum). The process to merge these fruits began in
            1883, however ran into problems with fruit set that were eventually
            solved with a chemical treatment called colchicine.

    description: >
      Strawberry plants are small forbs with a crown that grows shoots for
      leaves, flowers and fruit. The strawberry itself is an aggregate accessory
      fruit and what most people consider the "seeds" on the outside of the
      berry are actually the true botanical fruits. Strawberries come in a
      variety of colors from red to deep red, yellow and white. Production of
      berries depends on the type: june-bearing, everbearing, or day-neutral.


      ![Strawberry varieties](./strawberry-types.jpg)


      June bearing strawberries produce one large crop in June. The rest of the
      year they do not produce berries. Everbearing varieties produce two main
      crops, one in summer and one in the fall with a few berries in between.
      Day-neutral strawberries produce fruit continuously from spring until
      frost. Most cultivated varieties produce a similar total amount of fruit,
      the main difference is how spread out the production is. June-bearing
      types can be great for preserves, while day-neutral types are good for a
      constant supply of berries.


      Strawberries are excellent eaten fresh when fully ripe and make fantastic
      jams and smoothies.
