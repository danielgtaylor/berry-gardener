# Gooseberries

Gooseberries are bushes that grow blueberry to grape-sized berries with their own unique flavor that are sweet tart when ripe. The berries have visible veins and range in color from green, blushed pink, red, purple, and even black or white. The bushes have thorns but some varieties have few or small thorns, while for others the berries are far enough from the branches to make picking easier. The bushes live and produce berries for 25 years and sometimes more! All gooseberries require about 1000 - 1200 chill hours to break dormancy and produce fruit.

Gooseberries are very popular in Europe, but hardly available commercially in the U.S. due mostly to a federal ban on growing them enacted in 1920. In 1966 the federal ban was lifted, however it is still banned to grow gooseberries in some states because they are an alternate host for white pine blister rust.

Gooseberries can be eaten fresh when fully ripe and make excellent jams, jellies, and pies.

All dates below are for the Seattle, WA area (maritime pacific zone 8b).
