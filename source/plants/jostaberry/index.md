# Jostaberries

Jostaberries (pronounced "yostaberries") are bushes that grow clusters of small to medium berries that are sweet tart when ripe. First released in 1977, they are a tetraploid complex cross of the black currant R. nigrum, the North American coastal black gooseberry R. divaricatum, and the European gooseberry R. uva-crispa. Developed in Germany, the name is from the German words "<em>Jo</em>hannisbeere" (currant) and "<em>Sta</em>chelbeere" (gooseberry). Today several different varieties are available.

Jostaberries can be eaten fresh when fully ripe and make excellent jams, jellies, and juice.

All dates below are for the Seattle, WA area (maritime pacific zone 8b).
